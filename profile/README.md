# UC Denver Lynx Robotics Club

Welcome to the **UC Denver Lynx Robotics Club** GitHub organization! We are a multidisciplinary team of students from UC Denver passionate about building robots, learning about robotics, and competing in exciting robotics competitions. Whether you're interested in software, mechanical design, or electronics, there’s a place for you in our club!

## Our Mission

Our goal is to provide students with hands-on experience in designing, building, and programming robots while fostering a collaborative learning environment. We aim to compete in various robotics competitions, including the **National Robotics Competition (NRC)**, in events such as **Sumo Robots**, **MicroMouse**, and **Combat Robots**.

## Teams

Our club is organized into three main teams based on discipline:

- **Computer Science (CS) Team**:
  - Focus: Software development, robot control, algorithms, and sensor integration.
- **Mechanical Engineering Team**:
  - Focus: CAD design, 3D printing, and building the robot’s physical structure.
- **Electrical Engineering Team**:
  - Focus: Circuit design, motor control, sensor wiring, and power management.

Each competition team (Sumo, MicroMouse, Combat) is a cross-disciplinary team composed of members from each of these core groups.

## Current Projects

We are currently working on the following projects for the **NRC**:
- **Sumo Robot**: Build and program a robot designed to push an opponent out of the ring.
- **MicroMouse**: Develop an autonomous robot that can solve and navigate a maze.
- **Combat Robot**: Create a robot designed for competitive combat, focusing on durability and attack mechanisms.

## How to Get Involved

Interested in joining us? Here’s how you can get started:
1. **Join our club meetings**: Check out our [club website](https://example.com) or contact us at [email@example.com] to find out about our next meeting.
2. **Check out our repositories**: Browse the repositories for our ongoing projects (Sumo, MicroMouse, Combat Robots). Each repository includes instructions on how to get involved.
3. **Join a team**: Whether you’re into software, hardware, or electronics, you can contribute to one of our sub-teams.

### Contribution Guidelines

If you’re ready to contribute, be sure to check the **CONTRIBUTING.md** file in each repository for details on how to submit code, CAD models, or electrical designs. We're a collaborative team, and all contributions go through a review process to ensure the highest quality.

## Competitions

We regularly participate in national and local robotics competitions. Our major focus right now is the **National Robotics Competition (NRC)**, where we’ll be competing in:
- **Sumo Robots**
- **MicroMouse**
- **Combat Robots**

Stay tuned for updates on our progress and future competition results!

## Communication

We use the following tools to stay connected and work collaboratively:
- **GitHub**: All code, hardware designs, and electrical schematics are stored here.
- **Discord**: Join our [Discord server](https://example.com) for live discussions, team meetings, and quick questions.
- **Trello**: We use Trello to manage project tasks and keep track of progress.
